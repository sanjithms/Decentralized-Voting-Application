# Decentralized-Voting-Application
This app uses Ethereum and Solidity to create a secure, tamper-proof voting system. By using smart contracts, it automates counting and removes the need for central authorities. Users authenticate via MetaMask and vote through a React interface. Every vote is immutable and verifiable, ensuring transparency.
